The license headers in this directory are for prefixing the files in this project with a Mozilla Public License (MPL) license notice. These license notices should appear at the beginning of all Go (Golang), Javascript, HTML (Go HTML Template), and CSS files. They should also appear with any Python and Makefiles. Basically, since MPL licensing takes consideration of each file for licensing, these license notices should appear at the beginning of any source code file.
