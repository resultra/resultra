This package is for building the Electron client for single-user use of the application.

In development mode, the app is build using the following:

(1) npm install
(2) npm start

This will install all the modules needed to build the app and then launch it.

This client will connect to a tracking database server running locally. More development
is needed to launch the tracking database server from the Electron app itself.
