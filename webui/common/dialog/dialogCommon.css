/* Use with jQuery UI modal dialogs - this style will keep the dialog initially hidden from view and 
   allow menus and other elements to overflow the edge as appropriate */

/* TODO - Need to look at putting the following style back into dialogs:
    	overflow: visible !important;
	There was a conflict if the content of the dialogs expanded with error messages. In this case we want
	the contents to overflow, but we also want any dropdowns to show all their contents. 

	Note- Using a regular select HTML element doesn't have the same issues as Semantic UI dropdowns
