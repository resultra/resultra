 /* The standard bootstrap bg-* color classes don't work with form controls
   (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37863405/how-to-add-bootstrap-bg-x-e-g-bg-danger-classes-to-input-textboxes)
   So, what is needed is a set of formatting classes which accomplish the same/similar thing. The color codes are 
   duplicated from the bootstrap.css file from the bg-* css classes. */
