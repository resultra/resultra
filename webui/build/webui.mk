# TODO - the EXPORT_ASSETS rule will export *all* the assets found in assetManifest_gen.json
# However, many times an included asset from another package/directory will be exported multiple times
# if it is included from another directory. This means a single included asset may be exported many times,
# and possibily erroneously exported without its own injected asset lists included. There needs to be
# an enhancment to the overall build system to prevent assets from being exported more than once.
